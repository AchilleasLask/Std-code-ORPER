In this code, I first made a function which calculates the mean of a vector. In case the vector does not include any numbers, the function cannot calculate its mean, hence the output is "Vector is empty, cannot compute mean". Otherwise, the mean is calculated and presented as the function’s outcome.I then made a function which calculated the standard deviation of a vector. In case the vector does not include any numbers, the function cannot calculate its standard deviation and therefore the output is " Vector is empty, cannot compute standard deviation”. Otherwise, the standard deviation is calculated and presented as the function’s outcome.I also made the code as simple and straightforward as possible and added comments explaining its specific functions. I finally tested the code to confirm that it works properly.
